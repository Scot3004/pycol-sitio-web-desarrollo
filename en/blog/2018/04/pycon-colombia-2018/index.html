<p><a href="http://www.eafit.edu.co/english/Paginas/english-version-universidad-eafit-medellin-colombia-south-america.aspx">EAFIT University</a>: EAFIT is a university that inspires the current generations to embark on a life project that maximizes their potential. It is an institution that both conveys and generates knowledge, thus fulfilling its role as a teaching and research university. Research-backed teaching is another focal point of the institution’s roadmap, in so far as the goal is is not only to convey but to generate knowledge. In that regard, the budget allocated to this area has increased over time and enabled EAFIT to achieve a range of objectives, including the recognition by Colciencias of 38 research groups, the registration of 13 patents, and the participation of more than 900 students in research incubators. Another of the university’s primary objectives is to extend its national and international reach and impact. In that regard, it offers students the chance to participate in exchange programs abroad that enhance their academic and cultural development.</p>

<p>At 3pm, <a href="https://twitter.com/deborahhanus">Deborah Hanus</a>, Entrepreneur and Machine Learning researcher at MIT and Harvard, started her keynote talking about the importance of data collection in machine learning development. Instead of choosing which models fit best in the data, she explained the reasons of selecting or constructing good datasets. She also pointed out that it is very important to understand the data that is used to have insights and purge wrong inputs in the models.</p>
<p><img src="blog-pycon-2018-21.jpg" class="image fit" />
<small>Debora Hanus — Sunday afternoon keynote</small></p>
<p>The last keynote of the event was given by <a href="https://twitter.com/audreyr">Audrey Roy Greenfeld</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pydanny">Daniel Roy Greenfeld</a> coauthors of <a href="https://www.twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11">Two Scoops of Django</a>, and with their talk focused on the importance of open source projects and why they are still doing it. Among the benefits of open source software, they talked about the idea of crowdsourcing their problems and having the community to help them solve problems or think about new features. They encouraged the audience to build and release more projects in the <a href="https://pypi.org/">Python Package Index</a>, not only because of the crowdsourcing fact but also as a duty of the community to push Python language forward and help the ecosystem to grow with all the fantastic free tools that can be found. Finally, they drove us in the process of releasing <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/arepa/0.2.3">arepa</a>, an open source project built using a boilerplate project Audrey created, called <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookie-cutter</a>.</p>

<p>The Closing party was in Woka Bar were some the attendees, volunteers, Collaborators and Organizers had a couple of beers and got some time to relax.</p>
<h2>Scholarships</h2>
<p>The scholarships program is about the Python Colombia Community nurturing itself by making itself more accessible at PyCon Colombia. At PyCon Colombia 2017 the budget was tight, and the event could not set up scholarships program, in 2018 the organizers felt very proud to launch the scholarships program allowing tickets to be totally free for a group of 8 individuals that otherwise might not be able to attend to the conference, some of them shared their experience at PyCon Colombia 2018:</p>

<li><a href="https://pycon129210605.wordpress.com/">How was PyCon Colombia 2018</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There was a very unique moment when David Martinez, a 12 year old Colombian kid that sent an email (written in English!) to the event organizers asking for a scholarship to go to PyCon Colombia 2018 , he taught himself python with Codecademy and Udemy courses , also learned English at school and Duolingo, he wants to be an AI developer.</p>

<small><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeY447HlTEp/?taken-by=david_martinezqw" target="_blank">Letter written by David Martinez to PyCon Colombia organizers</a></small></p>
<p>The team was amazed there is such great example of hope for the childhood of this country, a ‘third world’ Spanish speaking country that unfortunately many people recognize internationally only because of drugs, “narcos”, internal armed civil conflict, among others.</p>
<p>It was a huge reminder for the PyCon Colombia team that there is still a lot to do to make this case, not an exception but a norm, a norm where 12-year-old Colombian girls and boys are very interested in learning how to code, how to speak a new language, learning to do what they love to do.</p>
<h2>Volunteers</h2>

<p>PyCon Colombia 2018 finally came to an end, and behind it there was a team that was exhausted from 3 full conference days but with a single thing in their mind: How are we going to take PyCon Colombia to the next level in 2019?</p>
<p><img src="blog-pycon-2018-27.jpg" class="image fit" />
<small>PyCon Colombia 2018 core team (Left to Right): Gonzalo Peña, Juan David Hernandez, Carlos Sierra, Johana Sanchez, John Roa, Jorge Martinez and Javier Daza</small></p>
<p>The next PyCon Colombia is currently planned for the 8, 9 and 10th of February of 2019, and the team has big and ambitious goals such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 conference days</li>
<li>450 attendees</li>
<li>10 sponsors</li>
<li>5 Partners</li>
<li>10 organizers</li>
<li>70 volunteers</li>
<li>8 keynote speakers</li>
<li>30 speakers</li>
<li>20 workshops</li>
<li>20 Scholarships</li>
</ul>
<p>There is currently a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-colombia-2019-tickets-43119726262">super fan ticket with a 35% discount</a> for all PyCon Colombia fans that liked PyCon Colombia 2017, loved PyCon Colombia 2018 and although they have no idea what is coming for PyCon Colombia 2019 , they feel will have a blast in the event the organizing team will prepare for next year.</p>
<p>As we make progress in the organization of the event for next year 2019, we will be posting updates and proposals on the different official communication channels so the Python community in Colombia can follow and learn about the different tasks and opportunities for volunteers to help with.</p>
